    	One person commits suicide about every 40 seconds, one person is murdered every 60 seconds and one person dies in armed conflict every 100 seconds. These numbers are based on a research from the World Health Organization. However, every 2 seconds there is an identity theft occurance according to Javelin Strategy & Research. Not to start off talking about something so dark, I simply wanted to show in reference how often our digital information is vulnerable to the outside world. I feel this has become a huge issue across the world and in the USA.

    	I wanted to touch on this topic because I have had identity theft issues of myself. Some in a large scale such as someone having all my personal information and opening credit cards, and even got to utilize $5000 worth of those cards. At least once a year I have noticed a fraudulent transaction either by scanning through my statement or getting a call from my bank that someone is buying gas in Tallahassee. Is this because I am incompetant and leave my information lying around? I navigate the web in ways that expose me to vulnerabilities in my operating system? No, not that at all. I wouldn't say I am an expert in security, but I have my share of knowledge spanning a couple decades. From 2600 meetings, internet, my brother's databank of knowledge, and just common sense. You won't find a post-it laying around with my social, DOB and my mother's maiden name laying around on my desk. I feel the infrastructure is due for a major overhaul. I have first hand experienced it working at several major corporations.

    	"What's the deal? Just fix it if it's a security fix! Come on. It's needed." We are thinking that right? How hard can it be? In the words of Shia LaBeouf "just do it!!!" Ok, seriously, let's take a look at why it's happening. Technology is moving at an exponential speed. It has been, as long as I have been alive. Up until several years ago, we didn't have a TV, computer, laptop, tablet, phone, and phablet, all for each person in the household. Companies who have grown to be massive in size take in direct proportion larger to move with this speed. Older technologies have, at most times, made gaps in the area security for our information. Whether that be locally on our PC's, or off-site somewhere sitting on Target's data servers. I know from my experience having worked at one of the largest financial firms, two of the largest gym corporations, and the largest chocolate store chain, they are several steps(years) behind.

    	I would say the list of reasons are fairly simply, but hard to eliminate. Here are some: a) money. It costs money to make a change! we can't spend money. It's not broken, don't fix it. b) ignorance. We don't fully understand when we do upgrade to newer technologies that they are still not on par with the vast security issues in the world. c) complexity. Again, we're trying to fend off any and every possible attack we could suffer that cause our personal information to be exposed but somewhere in the chain link fence there is a hole. d) arrogance. The worst of these all I feel, thinking "you're all set." But really, you are set for failure. Somewhere in the chain of command the person deciding on security matters thinks they have all the bases covered.

    	This is just my 2 cents, as I am sure this post could be picked apart but I feel strongly these aspects all combined would help resolve HUGE issues out their in our digital, financial, well-being. Until next week, adios.
