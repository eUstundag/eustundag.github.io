      It's been very exciting these past three weeks of DBC. Every week I am looking forward to next set of curriculum. What's the new challenge? What can I learn this week? How am I going to be better?

      I remember one of the main things I liked the most about Dev Bootcamp is the human aspect. There was so much communication and preliminary prep for us that I can see already this is something unique. One of the very cool steps we had to go over is <a style="greg" href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>. This helps understand what type "thinker" you are. I landed in concrete random pattern when I did the sorting test.

      This helped me understand why I do the things I do when I am studying. The random part of the gregorc thinking says I will end up at the correct solution whether I started at the end, beginning or middle. This is definitely true when I am reading material to learn. I tend to take small breaks, time box, so that I can return and stay focused on reading. This is the complete opposite when I am coding. I was paired with my partner for last week's challenge in replicating a website using html/css and before you know it, two and a half hours has passed by and we were cranking away non stop at the website. We had not taken a break but I didn't even notice because when it's visually in front of me.

      I feel the main thing I needed to improve is being more disciplined while time boxing myself in researching and learning new concepts. I know my strong suit is the "doing" part of things. I will go nonstop without needing a break, need be, while creating things.

      Today is Sunday, which means tomorrow is the new curriculum. Woohoo!
