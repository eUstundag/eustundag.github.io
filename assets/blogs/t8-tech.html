    Science is amazing. I could watch or read about space and be amazed every time that I do. From the largest planet to the smallest particle, it's amazing to watch and learn...at least for me.

    Let's look at a computer. It's amazing as to what it does, especially with today's technology. I grew up when computers were just become PC's - personal computers. My first computer was a 386, it cost an arm and a leg and it couldn't even run one of the games that run on your cell phone.

    So let's break it down, computers are simple, we turn it on, it does stuff we want, turn it off when done. It all starts with an electron, one of the smallest forms of matter and contains tons of energy. It "brings to life" a transistor inside the PC. There are a bunch of transistors which are basically either "on" or "off" - electricity or no electricity. They represent a number. So for example, an 8 bit transistor 0000 0001, represents a number. 0 is off, 1 is on. If it is 0000 0001, this is the number 1, if it is 0000 0011, this is the number 3. Number 2 would be 0000 0010. So, without getting into detail about the mathematics, this is how the computer starts calculating things to do. Software is written on the most basic level to help translate numbers into patterns...algorithms. The 0 and 1 language is called binary. The next step up is assembly language, another amazing language created to help in construction "instructions" on a higher level than binary. Assembly is used to construct many of the things we used today, such as operating systems, C, C++, so forth. These are another higher form of binary, so it is user friendly and you can get a lot more done because of the intermediary operating system translating for us to the computer.

    Let's get back to firing up the computer. So, transistors are firing, and telling the computer to come alive. The RAM is coming alive, the BIOS(basic hardware instructions are kicking in) telling the computer what to look for, a CD player, hard drive, two hard drives, a keyboard, mouse, etc. So it says "Hey, look for something in the hard drive or CD player, we're looking for an operating system." Hard drive has what we call a boot sector, if it has installed, let's say Windows 10, it will begin starting the operating system. This is when the CPU and hard drive really begin to start working a lot, processing operating system files to get you to your final destination -> a usable operating system, aka your Windows 10, Mac OSX. As it is processing this data, it needs a place to easily place this information for quick access, this is called the RAM. Any application running is stored here to have incredibly fast access.

    I forgot to mention, as we're starting the basic BIOS instructions is telling the monitor to turn on, keyboard to activate. Generally mouse is not active till we reach the operating system loading more instructions for the computer to handle usage of a mouse. Once we're here, everything else is turning on as well for use, your ethernet/wireless card(internet), your video card to it's fullest extent, the 2nd monitor you have connected, external harddrive. The operating system is now orchestrating your computer so that it runs in flawless(depending on what operating system you're running - almost flawless!) motion.

    It's evolved so much with amazing hardware and even more amazing engineers that computers now fit in our pockets and do nearly all of our tasks.
