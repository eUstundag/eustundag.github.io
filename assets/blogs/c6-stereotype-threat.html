  <h1>Stereotype threat.</h1>

    I actually was not aware there was such a grand study on this done with such specificity. I was aware of the underlaying topic. My interpretation of this in my life experiences would be prejudging. You are either prejudging yourself, or others. Stereotyping yourself, or others. If someone says they have not experienced this, then they have never interacted with another human being before.

    I have experienced this in many ways. One of the most frequent ones I can reflect on is when another person assumes you do not possess the tools to accomplish a certain task. You are either lacking logic, intelligence, knowledge, attention span, or willpower. This is of course, that person's "point of view." If someone told you "you are not good enough to do this.", wouldn't that get under your skin? It does for me. This would consciously or subconsciously effect anyone.

    I recall working at one of my previous jobs, as a sales person, along side with 3 other sales people. I had come to start working there after having worked roughly 5 years of direct field sales and as a sales trainer. I had also worked in that field of sales for 2 years just prior to start here. I was no newbie to what I was walking into.

    I don't have every event written in a notepad, however, I can recall roughly twice a week where my manager would give me a lecture on how I could of done something their way, instead of the way I did it. Not necessarily because it was better but simply because it was theirs. I had gotten the most successful result possible, a sale. This was not good enough. The fact that the newbie still had to become a veteran had not happened yet. Constant were the examples given of how others do their tasks, but no praise on how I had done them.

    Oh, but Ersan, maybe you weren't listening to the feedback? I believe that everything around us is feedback. Our interactions with others, with ourselves are the biggest lessons in life which we must pay attention to. I was listening to the feedback. And my methods were resulting in better sales numbers than the other 3 sales people who were on my team. Every month I produced better numbers than they did. I was the "newbie" and still had much to learn.

    I remember being isolated all the time in regards to who I am and what I was doing by my manager with all the many things directed my way. It added an extra barrier to overcome in my daily tasks. It would be in my mind at times as a reminder of why I did not do something well, or keep me second guessing, even though I would get positive results. It was frustrating to always be second to a less than effective example. I know that if I just had more honest feedback it would of helped me improve my skills even more.

    Provost Claude M. Steele had a speech he gave in regards to Stereotype Threat at Columbia University in New York. He went over many valid statistics and experiments which clearly prove you can hinder another person's performance when some sort of feedback is given to them in regards to why either they would not perform as well or why another group/person would perform better than them. As a remedy, he went back to the times when he was a graduate student and one of his professors had asked him to help with a study. He would give him tasks to do and keep pushing him to do better or to give him guidance. This was a positive experience in his life to reflect on. In reference to this, he went over an experiment done where they would ask a group of students to write feedback in regards to a professor they had in their studies. After having submitted their papers, the students were called back to the offices each of them were told "You did well in writing this paper, however I know that if you were go back and focus all of your efforts on making this better, I know you can do it." Out of the black students, 75% of them came back with a rewritten paper. The other groups were around the 30-40% range in returning. I believe 100% that being honest and kind can help propel all individuals forward, not just specific groups of people.

    Our society is always developing and growing. What we knew in the past tends to change going forward into the future. It will take time but eventually we will get there in helping each other grow.
