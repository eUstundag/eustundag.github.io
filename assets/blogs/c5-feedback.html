        I find pairing extremely fun. It's interacting with another human, and working together to accomplish a goal. I've found that it keeps me 1000% more focused on the task, as opposed to working alone. The tasks we were given were about were basic nested data structures and working with classes.

        There's always a cost vs benefit for everything. Almost always, your partner has something to contribute, to help you advance in your progress. In all of the tasks we have had to tackle, this has been the case. I can recall a few cases where I would of spent extra time researching to find a solution which my partner had an idea right off the bat. The negative instances I feel could be counted on one hand, out of the 5 weeks of pairing I have done so far. Just moments of either lack of communication or no communication to help the one party progress in parts of a challenge.

      Feedback, feedback, feedback...It feels good to hear good things about yourself. Majority of my feedback has been positive. I try to make sure that I am contributing to any pairing session, and that I am respectful of the other person. I did improve on some things that were left there by the individuals I paired with. I did see a few of my feedbacks rated by others and I didn't fully understand when someone voted it "disagreed with it being not kind" when the feedback itself was all about how much of a good job they did. I guess, as a person, just being able to understand that you are not perfect and that understanding others is the most important. Taking away any and every lesson from all of your encounters helps you propel yourself forward in life.

      I do know my biggest flaw in the process is not being verbose enough in my writing and reflections. I do not enjoy expressing myself through text. I don't even text very much on my cell phone unless necessary to communicate. I find it very impersonal but I do know that has to change. How else will I be understood? Or how will I be noticed if I don't have something for someone to research about me. I guess until I make it big and I'm on TMZ I will continue blogging and letting myself be known the to the universe.
