    They asked us to write about conflict and how we handled it. I've never had a conflict in my life...the end! Just kidding. I guess I could reflect on when I had spoken to my mother in regards to getting involved with DBC.

    I wouldn't necessarily use the word "conflict" but I would say that there was a disagreement in going back into the unknown of job hunting. At first I was frustrated because she would not see the bigger picture in making a decision like this. So what I focused on was elaborating further what the program is and where it would be good for my future, so that she could get a mental image of my future.

    Looking back at it I can't remember any negative aspects of what went down because she ended up seeing the bigger picture. Staying focused and keeping composure helps with letting my temper get the best of me in this case. Also expressing your thought process tends to help the other party get a clear vision of your reasoning.
