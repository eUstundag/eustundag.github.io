      Version control branching allows you or multiple people to work one the same core code at the same time. You can roll back on different functionalities or bug troubleshooting. Also, bigger projects can be integrated into the flowing main source code.

      From my understanding git tracks changes very simply, working, staged, and commit. Files pulled from main repository are worked on. Git will flag these as modified and you choose which to add and commit to the final changes. Pushing these to the online repo will ensure changes forever. This process becomes recursive with branching. Github is awesome for this because of it's ability to allow you to work offline till you are ready to send out your changes to the main repo.

      Did I mention github is awesome? github is awesome.
