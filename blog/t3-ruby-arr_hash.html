      Ruby 101 began this week and I am happy about that. I enjoy the coding part of the whole development process the most. For this week I will go over a brief overview of array and hash.
	  </p>
    <p>
      Arrays are a collection of items. It could be numbers, words, or even an array within the array. You can access this array by referencing a position, such as 3, 5, "end", or "beginning". Also we can cycle through the elements of the array to access the information.

      The [] brackets represent one element, and the information inside is the data.
      Array visual: [1][2][3][4][5][6]["something"]["bracket"]["data"][[1,2,3,]]
      #note: this is pseudo code, not how you would implement it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next...hashes! A hash is also a data collection, but you access the information directly(there is no position you can access) and you can assign a key name to get the value. So, for example, you can have a "Person" with keys "Hair, eyes, shoes, skin". The keys can be given values, in the case of our "Person" we can list "Hair = brown, eyes = blue, shoes = black". Then we would simply call these values by access Person.shoes to get the color of their shoe.

      We did some basic array manipulation this week and I am looking forward to the difficulties of more advanced problems!
