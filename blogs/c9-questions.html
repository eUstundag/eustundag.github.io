    I have worked in various industries and work a large variety of people. Many different backgrounds brings different communication styles to the table. Communication is the absolute cornerstone of any business, task, team, etc. Having worked as a manager for a long time you understand how to be "heard". Articulating the correct question or the answer is absolutely critical.

    <p>
    I've researched, practiced, and learned that it falls into very basic steps to formulate a proper question. Step 1: What is the question? How to reach the dev bootcamp campus. Step 2: What do you want to do? I want to go to the dev bootcamp campus. Step 3: How would you like to complete this task? I want to go to the dev bootcamp location via public transportation.
    </p>
    <p>
    So, imitating the stackexchange example of examples, a bad question: DEV BOOTCAMP?????.<br>
    Good question: How do I get to devbootcamp campus via public transportation?
    </p>
    <p>
    In the explanation of this question we would cover: where we are coming from to get to dbc? How much can you afford to pay for our commute? How much time do we have to get to our destination? Ultimately, you would include the criteria that is most important to complete the answer for your question. From my extensive sales background, "less is more." is the best method. Keeping the communication, short concise and simple leads to the higher understanding of the what you are trying to communicate.

    There's no one way to do approach this but I have found this is one of the more simpler ones.
