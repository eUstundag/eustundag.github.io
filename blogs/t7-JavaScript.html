  <h1>Ruby docs vs Javascript docs</h1>

    Another week, another post. We're moving along with our curriculum and we've landed on javascript. Let me tell you, it has not been a pleasure. I come from a background where I have experience with C# and now Ruby, and the javascript documentation leaves so much room for improvement!!! (I would put more exclamations if it were to emphasize my frustration more.)

    I am clearly not an expert at development, however, I found a huge difference in javascript resources in comparison to Ruby. I feel some of the explanations and examples on developer.mozilla.com are written without clarity, out of context or too complex for me to comprehend. For example, splice, the example given on syntax is this array.splice(start, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[, ...]]]). What? Maybe it's just me and I don't know enough. I found from using the function and outputing the result to give me a better idea on how to utilize it. array.splice(index, deleteCount, replaceExpression) would be a little better understanding how it works.

    We're doing a lot of practice with pseudo to code and I am seeing how bad pseudo or code can lead to "WTH?" situations. I have struggled with some of the content and challenges this week, it's actually more frustrating because I had almost zero issues working with Ruby. I guess javascript for me is a work in progress and I need to learn how to understand this documentation...or start my own !
