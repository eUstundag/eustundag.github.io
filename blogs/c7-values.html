    This has to be one of my favorite topics. Affirmations, stereotype threats and overcoming it all. Everywhere in life you will come across, technical term, BULLS***. At every turn of life you will either have this placed in your path or thrown at you. Only thing you can do is stepped past it. Mind you, it doesn't have to be major threats. Subtle ones will be more consistant than direct threats.

    I've accomplished many different things in my life, especially those which I had absolutely no experience with. Every time, the main factor against me would be myself. Fear would creep in, uncertainty, doubt, and everything else you could think of. External factors from others is jealousy, and lack of self esteem, which leads to stereotype threats.

    I know that I had a lot of things working to get there. Persistance, will power, and courage were the most powerful factors in helping me succeed. These all help me drive towards my goal. The obstacles did not matter, they were analyzed, evaluated, and overcome. I feel inspired, thinking of who I am, and the things I have accomplished in my life. Even if the measuring stick is based on where I was originally to now, that would be exceedingly enough.

    With these 3 attributes, I would say I am unstoppable. Not in the physical sense but in the psychological sense, I can accomplish anything. It sounds silly or over-the-top for those who might have experienced it. The simplest exercise would be to repeat your affirmations to yourself in your head, or out loud. These have a big impact on your life.
