      The difference between margin and padding did not make sense til I saw the diagram in chrome dev tools. Margin is the space outside of a border(if the border exists) and padding is the space inside the border between the border and content. Border is simple, it is the boundry around the content which you have created.
      A simple diagram, the diagram which helped me is this: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/images/boxdim.png">w3 box</a>.

      I struggled with the understanding of it for a few minutes. But when I manipulated the attributes and shifted things around, that helped the most. Hopefully in the soon this will seem natural to me!
