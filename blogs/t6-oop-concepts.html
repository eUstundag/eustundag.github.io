    There are 5 types of variables in Ruby.
      <ul>
        <li>local</li>
        <li>instance</li>
        <li>class</li>
        <li>global</li>
        <li>constant</li>
      </ul>
    These are used in every aspect of the language and are accessible in different ways. They have a scope in which they pertain to depending on how and when it is used.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p>
    Let's start with a local variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>def test_run</li>
        <li><span class="tab">x = 2</span></li>
        <li>end</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    This will only be able to be accesed when you are in method test_run. It must be passed as an argument to another method directly if you wish to access x. For example: next_method(x) - now next_method has the honor of utilizing x.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Next, we have instance variable. Easiest way to explain is this can be used in any instance of a class object.
    <ul>
        <li>class Example_Class</li>
        <li><span class="tab">def initialize</span></li>
        <li><span class="tab"><span class="tab">@x = 2</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="tab">end</span></li>
        <li><span class="tab">def test_run</span></li>
        <li><span class="tab"><span class="tab">puts @x</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="tab">end</span></li>
        <li>end</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>first_instance = Example_Class.new</li>
        <li>first_instance.test_run #=> 2</li>
      </ul>
      This piece of code defines a new class, Example_Class, initializes x = 2 everytime a new instance of this class is created. Method test_run is defined to use @x as the output to the terminal, value of it being 2 as initialized in the creation of the object.
      Anywhere in the object named first_instance we can access @x without having to pass as a parameter, and again, can not be accessed unless passed directly into another method.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
      Next up, class variable. This is almost identical to the instance variable however it can be accessed across ALL instances of the same class. So, in the example above for @x, we would define as @@x to make it clear that x is a class variable. This must be defined outside of the methods in the class. Anytime it is accessed it must be called as @@x in the class definition. Lets add a method to the class so we can modify the value of @@x.
      <ul>
        <li>def set_x(new_value)</li>
        <li><span class="tab">@@x = new_value</li>
        <li>end</li>
        <li>def get_x</li>
        <li><span class="tab">@@x</span></li>
        <li>end</li>
        <li>second_instance = Example_Class.new</li>
        <li>first_instance.set_x(14)</li>
        <li>puts second_instance.get_x #=> 14</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, in our example, our @@x variable was able to travel through time, space and class into second_instance, which is an instance of Example_Class, and give us the value of @@x which was set in first_instance.</p>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
      Now on our menu we have global variables. These are exactly what it sounds like. You can access these values anywhere in our program. You simple define as such: $x = 10
    </p>
    <p>This value can be access anywhere, in any class or method within the code.
      <ul>
        <li>puts $x #=>10</li>
      </ul>
      If we were within the class, we can also access with $x without any communication of parameters to methods or initialization within the class.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
      Last but not least, but the most stubborn, constant variables. These variables are declared outside of a class and method definition.
      <ul>
        <li>CONSTANT_X = 22</li>
      </ul>
      This can be accessed in the scope of which it was declared. So, either it will be a class variable or global variable depending on definition. And the main characteristic of a constant the value of the variable can not be changed once it has been declared. So, CONSTANT_X = 4, will give you an error.
    </p></li>
    </ol>
